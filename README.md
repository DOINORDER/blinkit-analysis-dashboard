📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow
🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle — from loading raw Excel data to generating insights through EDA, data cleaning, SQL analysis, and an interactive Power BI dashboard.
It concludes with a professional report and a presentation built using Gamma.

This repository showcases my skills in:

Data handling and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

SQL querying (MySQL / SQL Server)

Business intelligence and dashboard creation

Storytelling through reports and presentations

📁 Dataset

Source: Excel file (imported via Power Query & Python/Excel)

Content: Contains fields such as [replace with dataset columns]

Objective: Understand patterns, detect issues, and derive meaningful insights from raw data.

You can replace this section with actual dataset details when available.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Excel / Power Query – Initial data loading & transformation

Python (optional) – For EDA, visualization, and cleaning

SQL (MySQL / SQL Server) – For querying & analytical insights

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma – Automated slide deck presentation
